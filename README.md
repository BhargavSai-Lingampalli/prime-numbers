# prime-numbers
##How the code works

*First of all a prime number is a number that
is divisible only by itself and 1
*so all even numbers are not prime numbers(except 2)
since they are divisible by 2
*so we only check the odd numbers wheather it is 
prime or not.
*and we know that odd numbers are not divible by
even numbers.
*so we only check the odd numbers by dividing 
them with odd numbers to know wheather it is prime
or not.
*if the odd number not divible by the odd numbers 
from 3 to (n-1)odd number. n=(current number)
*if the current number is not divible numbers
between 3 to (n-1)number it is prime number.
(n=current number)
