List of Prime Numbers upto curtain Range

#How the code works
1.First of all a prime number is a number that
is divisible only by itself and 1
2.so all even numbers are not prime numbers(except 2)
since they are divisible by 2
3.so we only check the odd numbers wheather it is 
prime or not.
4.and we know that odd numbers are not divible by
even numbers.
5.so we only check the odd numbers by dividing 
them with odd numbers to know wheather it is prime
or not.
6.if the odd number not divible by the odd numbers 
from 3 to (n-1)odd number. n=(current number)
7.if the current number is not divible numbers
between 3 to (n-1)number it is prime number.
(n=current number)
